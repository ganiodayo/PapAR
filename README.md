# PapAR is becoming [PapARt](https://github.com/poqudrof/PapARt) 

PapAR was PapARt without depth camera nor projection. 
PapARt is a larger processing library 
for Augmented Reality. The ease of use is the same. It works with 
many camera, and depth cameras. 

Please switch to PapARt for your code and issues !
